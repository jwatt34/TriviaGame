# TriviaGame
This project uses Python to create a graphical user interface for a fun trivia quiz. The user is first shown a menu screen where they can select the difficulty of the questions and the number of the questions. The game then generates questions by accessing the API of the Open Trivia Database, and passing the user selections as parameters. From there, the user is taken to the game window. The question is shown on a canvas, and can be answered by pressing buttons for "true" or "false". If the user gets the answer correct, the screen will flash green, the score will be updated, and the next question will be shown. If the user answers incorrectly, the screen will flash red before moving to the next question. Once the quiz is completed the user will see their final score.
